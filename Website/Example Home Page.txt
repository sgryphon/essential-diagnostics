! Microsoft Diagnostics Logging

!! _Using and extending System.Diagnostics trace logging_

System.Diagnostics provides powerful, flexible, high performance 
logging for applications -- and it's already built into the .NET Framework!

This project uses the inbuilt features of the System.Diagnostics 
namespace, and shows how logging and tracing can be integrated 
into a client application whilst taking advantage of the services
exposed by System.Diagnostics.

This project also provides a library that enhances System.Diagnostics 
through it's numerous built-in extension points, but shouldn't require 
any changes to existing code (that uses System.Diagnostics) to use 
some or all of the features.

Extension features provided by this project are 
marked [image:EX|ex.png] -- other features are already provided
by the .NET Framework you are using right now.

!! Features

System.Diagnostics provides the following key features:

 * Multiple logging sources.
 * Output to multiple trace [listeners|Listeners] with different [filtering|Filters].
 * Logical operation context and activity correlation.
 * Multiple levels of event types including activity tracing.
 * Integrates with existing .NET Framework tracing (such as WCF).
 * Proven architecture.
 * Flexible and extensible design.
 * High performance.
 * No change required to existing .NET Framework trace statements.

System.Diagnostics logging can be used to write information to any of the following [Listeners|listeners]:

 * A [text file|FileLogTraceListener]
 * The command [console|ConsoleTraceListener]
 * The [event log|EventLogTraceListener]
 * [ASP.NET|WebPageTraceListener] tracing
 * The [debug output|OutputDebugStringTraceListener] stream
 * An [XML|XmlWriterTraceListener] file
 * Event Tracing for Windows (Vista [ETW|EventProviderTraceListener])
 * A [database|SqlTraceListener] [image:EX|ex.png]
 * An [e-mail message|SmtpTraceListener] [image:EX|ex.png]

Log information can be [custom formatted|Tokens] and include context information such as:

 * Event id, type, and message
 * Source - allows you to partition your logs
 * Event time and date
 * Thread id, process id and call stack
 * Logical operation stack, activity id, and correlation
 * Machine name, user name and Windows Identity [image:EX|ex.png]
 * Custom [properties|DynamicPropertyReader] [image:EX|ex.png]
