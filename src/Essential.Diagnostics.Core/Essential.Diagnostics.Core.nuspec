    <description>
      Core library for Essential.Diagnostics, with a common base class for trace listeners. It also includes a generic formatter, a generic expression-based trace filter, and a file watcher for configuration changes.

      Other Essential.Diagnostics packages extend the .NET Framework System.Diagnostics trace logging with additional trace listeners. Included are colored console (that allows custom formats), SQL database (including a tool to create tables), rolling file (with custom formats), rolling XML, email (per trace or batched), and an in-memory trace listener.

      The Essential.Diagnostics project also publishes structured data (semantic) tracing extensions and a fluent client library that includes easy encapsulation of activity and logical operation scopes, as well as abstractions and templated classes for a simpler logging API and support for dependency injection frameworks.

      See the project site on GitHub for examples and documentation.
