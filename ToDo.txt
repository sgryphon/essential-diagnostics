  This would allow different templates to be used with different filters.

- Add HttpContext items (if available) to TraceFormatter.

- Add MinimumTrustTraceSource; for use in low-trust environments.

- Improve TraceConfigurationMonitor to support system.diagnostics section in separate config file.
