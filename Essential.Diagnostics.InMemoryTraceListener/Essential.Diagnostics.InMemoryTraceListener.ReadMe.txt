Using and extending System.Diagnostics trace logging. 

In memory trace listener extension for System.Diagnostics, 
along with required config sections. This listener is useful 
for unit testing that logging has occurred.

Other Essential.Diagnostics packages extend the .NET Framework 
System.Diagnostics trace logging with additional trace listeners. 
Included are colored console (that allows custom formats), 
SQL database (including a tool to create tables), rolling file 
(with custom formats), rolling XML, email (per trace or batched), 
and an in-memory trace listener.

The Essential.Diagnostics project also publishes a fluent client 
library that includes easy encapsulation of activity and logical 
operation scopes, as well as abstractions and templated classes 
for a simpler logging API and support for dependency injection 
frameworks.

See the project site on CodePlex for examples and documentation.
