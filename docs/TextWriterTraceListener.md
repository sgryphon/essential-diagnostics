# TextWriterTraceListener Class

Writes trace events to a simple file.

If you want to write trace events to a text file using only the .NET Framework, it is strongly recommended that you use [FileLogTraceListener](FileLogTraceListener) instead (which is in the Visual Basic namespace). 

Alternatively with Essential.Diagnostics you can used [RollingFileTraceListener](RollingFileTraceListener), which allows a customised output format and alternative creation frequencies.
